How to measure the success of the Instagram TV product

Project 1: Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product? 


**PROJECT**

As a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, measuring the success of the Instagram TV (IGTV) product would involve an analysis of various metrics e.g. user engagement, content, and feedback from users.

From my understanding, Instagram TV contributes to the general mission statement by allowing content creators and users to make and share longer video content. Instagram TV gives users space to share more insights into their lives which creates a deeper connection, this deeper connection can increase the amount of time a user can spend on your content thus increasing revenue.

The business goal of Instagram is to increase user engagement and revenue from ads. For the users, the goal is to share content or be able to consume content.

**User Engagement**:

This a metric that can be used to track down the number of users who have viewed a post thus helping to measure the overall viewership trends, can also measure the amount of time a user spends on a posted video, calculate the rate at which a user has engaged on a post by considering the number of likes, comments, shares, and saved videos/posts. In the end, one will be able to know the average time spent and average revenue generated at a given period of time.

**Content**:

Content is another metric that can be used to measure the success of an Instagram TV. The popularity of a post/video can be identified based on the number of likes, comments, shares, and saved posts. One needs to analyze the type of content that has many views and generates the average engagement. Analyze the population or group of people engaging with IGTV to refine content and use the information in strategic planning. In the end, make sure to measure the effectiveness of content moderation procedures to maintain a safe and compliant platform.

**User Feedback**

Analyze the user feedback by conducting surveys to help understand user satisfaction and areas of improvement if any. One can conduct the surveys using the user comments and sentiments on IGTV.

Value added and Retention: Analyze the revenue generated from the ads, and be able to track the income and the growth of Instagram's subscriber base. Help analyze how many users return to Instagram over time and the number of new users. Look for ways to increase the number of new users and retain IGTV users as a long-term solution by developing a strategy that aligns with Instagram's overall product strategy.

**Competitive Analysis**:

It's important to analyze the competitors' information by comparing their performance metrics in order to understand the market position and plan on the way forward. Perform a SWOT analysis for each competitor and analyze their marketing efforts, including advertising channels, content strategy, and promotional campaigns. Identify their key messages and branding elements. Keep in mind that a competitive analysis is an ongoing process. Market dynamics change and thus need to regularly monitor and update your analysis to stay competitive.

**Technical Analysis**:

Analyze the response time to ensure that the posts load as quickly as possible without interruptions to improve user experience. Analyze the reliability, stability, and availability to enhance the accessibility of the content and finally evaluate the system's security measures and vulnerabilities.

Technical performance analysis should be an ongoing process. Continuously monitor, analyze, and improve performance.

**Conclusion**

The success of IGTV should be regularly monitored and adjusting the product accordingly will help in achieving and maintaining the success of the IGTV product.
